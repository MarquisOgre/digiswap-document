**DigiSwap helps you make the most out of your crypto in three ways:**

**Trade, Earn, and Win.**
{% endhint %}

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

DigiSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, with the highest trading volumes in the market.

### Low fees

Why pay more? DigiSwap runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, DigiSwap doesn‚Äôt hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## üí∏ Earn

> Earn DIGIS and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with DGSweet Pools

Stake DIGIS, earn free tokens. It‚Äôs really that easy.\
DIGIS holders right now are earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn DIGIS with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn DIGIS. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the DGSweet Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn‚Äôt supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

<!-- ## üé≤ Win

> DigiSwap makes making money fun.

### Lottery

**Millions of dollars** regularly go up for grabs on the DigiSwap Lottery.\
Join as many as **11,000 daily players** for your chance to win big!

### NFT Collectibles

Win collectible NFTs for participating in trading competitions and more fun & games.

### Prediction

Win BNB if you can predict whether the BNB price will rise or fall.\
New rounds every 5 minutes!\\ -->
