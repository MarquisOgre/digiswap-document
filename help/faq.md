## How can I stake DIGIS?

You can stake your DIGIS in Digiswap Syrup Pools. Visit the [Syrup Pools page](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Syrup Pools guide](https://docs.digiswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Syrup Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more DIGIS by supporting Digiswap.

Staking only needs some DIGIS to be added to a Syrup Pool to earn DIGIS or other tokens.\
[Learn more about Syrup Pool staking.](https://docs.digiswap.finance/products/syrup-pool)

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn DIGIS.\
[Learn more about Yield Farming.](https://docs.digiswap.finance/products/yield-farming)

## How do I farm?

We have a [Yield Farming guide](https://docs.digiswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) if you're interested in learning how to farm.

## Where can I view the Digiswap roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://docs.digiswap.finance/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to Binance Smart Chain and Digiswap?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to Digiswap guide](https://docs.digiswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for Digiswap?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](https://docs.digiswap.finance/get-started/wallet-guide) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](https://docs.digiswap.finance/help/troubleshooting) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

You can also see our [Fixing Stuck Pending Transactions guide](https://docs.digiswap.finance/help/unsticking-a-transaction-stuck-as-pending-with-metamask) if you have a stuck transaction.

## When will you open more pools?

New Pools are added to Digiswap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the [announcements Telegram group](https://t.me/DigiswapAnn) to learn about new Pools as early as possible.

## Did Farm APR calculation change?

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on Digiswap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to Digiswap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

## How can I report a bug?

Learn about our [bug bounty and potential bounty payouts](https://docs.digiswap.finance/code/bug-bounty).

## Where can I view smart contracts?

Learn how to find smart contracts on our [Finding Contracts page](https://docs.digiswap.finance/code/smart-contracts/finding-contracts).

## Why does it say I have no BNB balance?

If you've already [transferred BNB into your Binance Smart Chain-enabled wallet](https://docs.digiswap.finance/get-started/bep20-guide) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.digiswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Binance Smart Chain (BSC) selected.

## Is Digiswap protected from flashloan attacks?

Digiswap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. Digiswap’s DIGIS token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, DIGIS token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

Digiswap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.

## Can I join the Digiswap team?

Check the [Become a Chef](https://docs.digiswap.finance/hiring/become-a-chef) area for information on open positions we're looking to fill.

We advertise new positions we're looking to fill on our [official social media channels](https://docs.digiswap.finance/contact-us/telegram), so be sure to follow us to get the latest hiring information.

## What is SYRUP?

SYRUP was a part of the staking process earlier in Digiswap's life. SYRUP was discontinued when a security issue was discovered and is no longer a part of Digiswap.
