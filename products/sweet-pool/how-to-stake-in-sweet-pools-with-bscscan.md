# How to Stake in Sweet Pools with BscScan

![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-2-%20%282%29.png)

Some users may want to take advantage of Digiswap's Sweet Pools using BscScan instead of the website UI.

You'll be interacting with one of two contracts, depending on if you want to use the Auto DIGIS Sweet Pool, or one of the other available Sweet Pools. This guide will help you through interacting with the contracts and get you stacking those sweet, sweety rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please understand that using BscScan to interact with contracts is not recommended for beginners. If you're not feeling confident, we suggest using the [How to Stake in Sweet Pools guide](https://docs.digiswap.finance/products/sweet-pool/sweet-pool-guide) instead.
