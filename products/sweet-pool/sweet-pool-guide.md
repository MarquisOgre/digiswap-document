# How to Stake in DGSweet Pools

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/docs masthead (15) (1).png>)

Staking in [DGSweet Pools](https://docs.digiswap.finance/products/sweet-pool) lets you earn DIGIS or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with Digiswap's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually DIGIS.

## **Getting started with Sweet Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page [here](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools).

2\. Connect to your Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Sweet Pool you want to stake in.

**Auto DIGIS** automatically compounds your rewards: any DIGIS you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual DIGIS** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto DIGIS. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other DGSweet Pools let you stake your DIGIS to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.\

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to **"**Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Sweet Pool. Auto DIGIS will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing DIGIS from a pool** ****

You can easily  add more DIGIS to a Sweet Pool, or move some DIGIS to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked DIGIS.

1\. Click the **-** to take some DIGIS out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto DIGIS pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.
