# Roadmap

![](<.gitbook/assets/docs masthead (19) (1).png>)

_Updated Jan. 21, 2022_

### Finally, it's a roadmap not a to-do list.

Crypto moves fast, and we move fast too.

Pivoting is a way of life.

That means that we donâ€™t publicly commit to specific timelines, so we can organize our development priorities based on market changes and developer resources.
