# DGP Tokenomics

## **Emission rate** <a href="#emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                                                                | **Emission/block (DGP)** | **Emission/day (DGP)** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: | ----------------------: |
| Emission                                                                  |                        40 |               1,152,000 |
| Burned Weekly [(PID 138)](cake-tokenomics.md#why-is-the-cake-burn-manual) |                    -25.75 |                -787,600 |
| **Effective Emission**                                                    |              **<14.25\*** |           **364,400\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 DGP per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery, and burned (PID 137 - Details below).

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of DGP is also [minted to the Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0xceba60280fb0ecd9a5a26a1552b90944770a4a0e#tokentxns) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 DGP are harvested, then 9.09 DGP is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
All DGP minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn and never enters circulation.&#x20;

As such, we haven't included it in the above emission rate.
{% endhint %}

## Distribution <a href="#distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to                | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total DGP) |           Reward/day |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------: | ------------------------: | -------------------: |
| Farms and Lottery             |                       10.62% |                      4.25 |     122,400 (approx) |
| of which diverted and burned  |                              |                           |              -46,000 |
| Syrup Pools                   |                          25% |                        10 |     288,000 (approx) |
| **Total Daily DGP Emission** |                              |                           | **364,400 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="#other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
{% endhint %}

As well as the above, DGP is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on Digiswap V2
* **100%** of DGP sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of DGP performance fees from IFOs
* **100%** of DGP spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **100%** of DGP bid during Farm Auctions
* **20%** of DGP spent on lottery tickets
* **45,000** DGP per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (_The DGP for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
* **3%** of every Prediction markets round is used to buy DGP for burning
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto DGP Pool
* **2%** of every NFT sale on the NFT Market is used to buy DGP for burning

## Why is the DGP burn manual?

To hit the ground running, Digiswap launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) with the MasterChef contract emitting 40 DGP per block. For that reason, the early team didn't add additional functions such as the ability to customize the DGP minting logic. As migrating to a new MasterChef would require a lot of time and effort, the team opted to reduce DGP emissions instead through a manual burn process by creating two pools:

* Legacy Lottery Pool (PID - 137) - burned DGP from the lottery
* Burn Pool (PID - 138) - burned DGP per block

These pools work similarly to the farms, where the Chefs can adjust the percentage of the 40 DGP per block allocated to it after each DGP emission reduction vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On the day of the burn, the supply shown on the homepage might suddenly jump by several million DGP.&#x20;

Don't worry - **THIS DGP NEVER ACTUALLY ENTERS CIRCULATION:**
{% endhint %}

This apparent jump is just because of how all the DGP that's allocated for the burn is stored during the week.&#x20;

The DGP sent to both pools PID-137 and PID-138 are harvested before completing the weekly token burns, and this makes the Total Supply shown on the site jumping by \~6M. This is because pending DGP isnâ€™t registered in the Total Supply until it's harvested on the burn day. Once the token burn transaction is completed, the \~6M is shown in the Burned to Date.&#x20;

## How to Confirm DGP Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating DGP supply shown on the Digiswap homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the DGP token contract on BscScan and [see how much DGP is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of DGP that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual DGP supply.
