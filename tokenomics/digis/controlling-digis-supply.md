# Controlling DIGIS supply

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/digistokenomic.png>)

## Why DIGIS has no hard cap

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of DIGIS token, making it an inflationary token.&#x20;

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the chefs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

> DIGIS's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. _Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity (LP fees etc. would remain)._

**So what are the other ways DIGIS's supply is limited, to counter inflation?**&#x20;

## How DIGIS supply is reduced without a hard cap

The chefs aim to **makedeflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into Pancakeswap's products**.** The goal is for more DIGIS to leave circulation than the amount of DIGIS that's produced.


### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0Ff81F18bCb9519ac6027c732D196945CA4D2a9A?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of Digiswap's products (like a 10% burn of DIGIS spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the **** [**DIGIS Tokenomics page**](https://docs.digiswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) **** for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
