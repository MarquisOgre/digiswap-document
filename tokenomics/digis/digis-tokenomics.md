## **Emission rate** <a href="#emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**                                                                | **Emission/block (DIGIS)** | **Emission/day (DIGIS)** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------: | ----------------------: |
| Emission                                                                  |                        40 |               1,152,000 |
| Burned Weekly [(PID 138)](cake-tokenomics.md#why-is-the-cake-burn-manual) |                    -25.75 |                -787,600 |
| **Effective Emission**                                                    |              **<14.25\*** |           **364,400\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional 45,000 DIGIS per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the lottery, and burned (PID 137 - Details below).

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of DIGIS is also [minted to the Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0xceba60280fb0ecd9a5a26a1552b90944770a4a0e#tokentxns) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 DIGIS are harvested, then 9.09 DIGIS is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
All DIGIS minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn and never enters circulation.&#x20;

As such, we haven't included it in the above emission rate.
{% endhint %}

## Distribution <a href="#distribution" id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to                | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total DIGIS) |           Reward/day |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------: | ------------------------: | -------------------: |
| Farms and Lottery             |                       10.62% |                      4.25 |     122,400 (approx) |
| of which diverted and burned  |                              |                           |              -46,000 |
| Sweet Pools                   |                          25% |                        10 |     288,000 (approx) |
| **Total Daily DIGIS Emission** |                              |                           | **364,400 (approx)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a href="#other-deflationary-mechanics" id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
{% endhint %}

As well as the above, DIGIS is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on Digiswap V2
* **100%** of DIGIS sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of DIGIS performance fees from IFOs
* **100%** of DIGIS spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **100%** of DIGIS bid during Farm Auctions
* **20%** of DIGIS spent on lottery tickets
* **45,000** DIGIS per day (historically assigned to the lottery) (_The DIGIS for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
* **3%** of every Prediction markets round is used to buy DIGIS for burning
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto DIGIS Pool
* **2%** of every NFT sale on the NFT Market is used to buy DIGIS for burning

## Why is the DIGIS burn manual?

To hit the ground running, Digiswap launched as an MVP (minimum viable product) with the DigiMaster contract emitting 40 DIGIS per block. For that reason, the early team didn't add additional functions such as the ability to customize the DIGIS minting logic. As migrating to a new DigiMaster would require a lot of time and effort, the team opted to reduce DIGIS emissions instead through a manual burn process by creating two pools:

* Legacy Lottery Pool (PID - 137) - burned DIGIS from the lottery
* Burn Pool (PID - 138) - burned DIGIS per block

These pools work similarly to the farms, where the Chefs can adjust the percentage of the 40 DIGIS per block allocated to it after each DIGIS emission reduction vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On the day of the burn, the supply shown on the homepage might suddenly jump by several million DIGIS.&#x20;

Don't worry - **THIS DIGIS NEVER ACTUALLY ENTERS CIRCULATION:**
{% endhint %}

This apparent jump is just because of how all the DIGIS that's allocated for the burn is stored during the week.&#x20;

The DIGIS sent to both pools PID-137 and PID-138 are harvested before completing the weekly token burns, and this makes the Total Supply shown on the site jumping by \~6M. This is because pending DIGIS isnâ€™t registered in the Total Supply until it's harvested on the burn day. Once the token burn transaction is completed, the \~6M is shown in the Burned to Date.&#x20;

## How to Confirm DIGIS Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating DIGIS supply shown on the Digiswap homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the DIGIS token contract on BscScan and [see how much DIGIS is held by the Burn Address.](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82#balances) That's the total amount of DIGIS that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual DIGIS supply.
